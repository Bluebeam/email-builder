    We’ve estimated that it’s saved us
    about 2-3 weeks per review. It’s taken
    a stunning amount of time out of our

    A lot of our customers tell us that Bluebeam® Revu® has made their teams more productive by allowing them to collaborate more efficiently. Like this award-winning design firm that took on a $2 billion hospital project with more than 5,900 pages of architectural drawings.
    With its best-in-class markup tools and built-in collaboration capabilities, Revu helped save them two to three weeks per design review. That adds up to hundreds of work hours over the life of the project—which is a lot of time (and labor costs) saved!
    The next step is simple: Try Revu for yourself, free for 30 days.
