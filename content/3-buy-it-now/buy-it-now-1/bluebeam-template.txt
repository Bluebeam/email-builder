    "We’ve estimated that it’s saved us
    about 2-3 weeks per review. It’s taken
    a stunning amount of time out of our
    QA/QC process.”

    By switching from paper to Revu, the firm **saved two to three weeks per design review**, which added up to hundreds of work hours over the life of the project. How much time could you save with Revu?
