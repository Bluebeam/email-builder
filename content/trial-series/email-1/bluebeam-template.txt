    A lot of our customers tell us that Bluebeam® Revu® has made their teams more productive by allowing them to collaborate more efficiently. Like (link: #  text: this award-winning design firm) that took on a **$2 billion hospital** project with more than 5,900 pages of architectural drawings.

    With its **best-in-class markup tools and built-in collaboration** capabilities, Revu helped **save them two to three weeks per design review**. That adds up to hundreds of work hours over the life of the project—which is a lot of time (and labor costs) saved!
