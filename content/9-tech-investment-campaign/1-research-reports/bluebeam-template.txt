    Hi [name],

    $1.2 trillion.
    (spacer:10)
    That’s how much money the engineering and construction industries will save over the next 10 years by replacing outdated processes with new digital technology.1

    The bulk of those returns won’t be distributed evenly: They’ll go to the firms that invest in the future. Bluebeam can help you get there, with forward-thinking software and cloud solutions that allow you to work more efficiently, make processes more predictable and reduce the risk level of complex projects.

    I’d love to talk more with you about how a small technology investment can bring huge rewards to your company. Please give me a call at your convenience.
