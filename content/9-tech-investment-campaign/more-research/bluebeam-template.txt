    Hi [name],
    (spacer:10)
    The construction industry is lagging far behind the rest of the business world.
    (spacer:10)
    According to a recent McKinsey report, productivity per construction employee has improved by just **1% per year**, compared to **3-4%** across other sectors. 1 It’s probably because the industry has invested a lot less in information technology than the rest of the economy.
    (spacer:10)
    The data is pretty clear: Companies that spend wisely on tech will be rewarded with growth. Those that don’t, will be left behind.

    I’d love to talk with you about how Bluebeam can help [your company] to keep moving forward. Please give me a call at your convenience.
