    Hi [name],
    (spacer:10)
    Are there any errors or inefficiencies that you’ve noticed occurring regularly with projects at your company? They’re eventually going to affect your bottom line.
    (spacer:10)
    So many Bluebeam customers have realized significant savings in both time and money—from (link: # text: faster design and submittal reviews), to (link: # text: fewer errors), to more (link: # text: repeatable, predictable processes) across their project teams. I think we can do the same for you.
    (spacer:10)
    If any of these stories gave you some food for thought, give me a call. I’m always happy to talk about what Bluebeam can do for your business.
