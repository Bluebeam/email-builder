    * **Direct costs** of printed plans, shipping, etc.
    * **Project downtime** resulting from poor communication and coordination
    * **Costly mistakes** leading to rework or even litigation

    I’m sure I can help you find ways for Revu to start saving you money immediately. Give me a call anytime you’d like to take a look at the numbers.
