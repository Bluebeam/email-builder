    Using Revu’s custom tool sets,
    profiles and data-tracking features, we
    can finally standardize how we capture
    that data… Now the entire estimate can
    get handed off to the project team.”

    Another thing we often hear from customers is that Bluebeam® Revu® helps make their processes more repeatable, more predictable, and ultimately, much more efficient.

    One leading full-service contracting firm, for example, (link: http:// text: told us about) how they used Revu to help **standardize their preconstruction services**. With Revu, they were able to **capture quantity data** once and keep it in a **single, centralized location** to use again and again throughout their projects.

    And having teams across the country now using the same **customizable, shareable tool sets** made it that much easier to **predict—and control**—project timelines and costs.
