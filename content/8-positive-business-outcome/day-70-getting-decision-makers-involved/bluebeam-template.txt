    Hi [name],
    (spacer:10)
    When you talk about investing in new software, who needs to “buy in” before anything actually gets bought?

    The truth is, it varies from company to company. It could be the CIO, or a group of influential project managers, or the director of IT or VDC. It could even be the CEO.

    I’d be more than happy to help you get the right people at [your company] on board with Bluebeam. Give me a call when you’re ready.
