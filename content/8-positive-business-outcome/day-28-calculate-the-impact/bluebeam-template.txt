    I often help Bluebeam customers pinpoint areas where our solutions could bring substantial cost savings. Here are a few common themes I hear from people:

    ### Direct Costs
    On a complex project, printing and shipping charges can add up quickly. Most of these can be eliminated with Bluebeam Revu.

    ### Project Delays and Downtime
    Poor communication and coordination, slow approvals and a lack of accountability can bring work to a standstill. Revu makes effective collaboration easy.

    ### Costly Mistakes
    Lack of access to the latest information can lead to expensive rework, or even penalties or litigation. With Revu, teams can stay on the same page.

    How much profit did these factors eat up on your last project? And how many projects does [your company] handle in a typical year? Do the math, and you’ll start to see how quickly the costs of outdated processes add up.

    When you’re ready to talk about the ROI for Bluebeam, give me a call. I’m confident we can help you improve your bottom line, too.
