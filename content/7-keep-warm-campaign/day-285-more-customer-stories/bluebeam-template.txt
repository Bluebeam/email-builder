    Hi [name],
    Is now a good time to explore how Bluebeam Revu can help you deliver more of your projects on time and under budget?
    (spacer:10)
    So many of our customers have realized significant savings, in both time and moneyâ€”from (link: # text: faster design and submittal reviews), to (link: # text: fewer errors), to more (link: # text: repeatable, predictable processes) across their project teams. I think we can do the same for you.
    (spacer:10)
    I know your time is valuable and limited. Do you have 5-10 minutes to connect and talk through a few ideas on how Revu can help your teams work more efficiently?
