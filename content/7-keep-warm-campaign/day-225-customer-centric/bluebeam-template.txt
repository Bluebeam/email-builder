    Hi [name],
    (spacer:10)
    The beta programs at Bluebeam are a great way for customers to get involved.

    In our beta last year, we heard that onboarding was an issue. So, our engineering team got to work, and, today, new user onboarding is a reality within Revu. (link: # text: You can read all about it here).

    What do you wish you could do with the technology solutions that help you build? Let me know, and weâ€™ll see if we can make it a reality in a future update to Revu!
